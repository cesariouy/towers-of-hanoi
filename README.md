# Tower of Hanoi

This is my version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" target="_blank">ancient mathematical puzzle</a>, played through a command-line interface. This program was written purely in Ruby, and can be launched from a Ruby interpreter. **Recommended difficulty**: 3-5 discs.
